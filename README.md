# PGGAN  :octocat: 
This repository contains the implementation of the paper [
Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196) in Pytorch.
The following experiment will been carried out on MNIST dataset.


## Tasks to do:
- [x] Classes for Generator,Discriminator and PGGAN
- [x] add_layer functions
- [x] adding smoothing  branch
- [x] **Training** procedure.
- [x] Data Loader and Transforming them for training.
- [ ] Training it on MNIST data and uploading trained model
- [ ] minibatch discrimination
- [ ] weight normalisation
